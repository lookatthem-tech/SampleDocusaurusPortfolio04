# API docs

I have created a lot of documentation for developers over the years. I have also taken several courses about how to create API docs.	

Please browse the following sections to see examples of things I’ve done in the areas of API docs, Docs-As-Code tools, github versioning and deployment, jekyll, and sphinx.

## Github site example

To further demonstrate my capabilities to work with modern developer doc tools, I used github to build, edit, version, and deploy this portfolio site that you are currently viewing.

## Jekyll example

I've also built an example of a developer style of site with jekyll. I built the site in a github repo and hosted it on github pages. You can see it [here](https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/jekyll-project-03/index.html).

## OpenAPI example

I created an API documentation site on github that uses data from the Swagger PetStore Sample API. I built the site with the highly respected and most commonly used specification: OpenAPI. I'm very experienced with CSS, so I can style sites like this to fit any branding and format that a company needs. You can see this site [here](https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/PetStoreOpenAPI/#/).

## Madcap Flare example

If you use Madcap Flare to create your Help content, you might want to also use Flare to create and maintain your API documentation. Here are two API reference examples that I created with Flare. I built these in a github repo. This could provide a method to use Flare to maintain your API documentation, rather than  use Jekyll, Hugo, Sphinx, or the many other Docs As Code tool sets.

You can see an example with a one column format [here](https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/ApiDocsInFlare/Output/ryan_/HTML5/Content/RRApiReference1Col.htm).
You can see an example with a two column format [here](https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/ApiDocsInFlare/Output/ryan_/HTML5/Content/RRApiReference3Col.htm).

## Sphinx site example

I have a similar portfolio site that I built with sphinx to demonstrate what I can do with that tool.

:::note
I haven’t hosted this site anywhere yet. But I’ll be happy to show it to anyone who asks!
