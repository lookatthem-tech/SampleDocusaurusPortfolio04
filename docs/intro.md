:::note Important message about this Docusaurus portfolio

I created this portfolio site to demonstrate my capabilities with writing, editing, styling (CSS), building, and deploying Docusaurus sites. I store and version my Docusaurus content in github, where I also host the site you're viewing. At this time, this Docusaurus portfolio includes only a subset of content from my full portfolio. To see many more samples of my work, please see [my full portfolio site](https://lookatthem-tech.github.io/portfolio005/Content/Topics/HomePgG.htm).

This portfolio is just a small sampling of what I have done and what I can do. If you would like to see more examples or have any questions, feel free to contact me via my LinkedIn profile.
