# Welcome to Prysm for rooms!

The following sections show you how to use Prysm to be more productive.

## What's a project?

You start with the **project** you want to organize. Think of a project you're working on, such as planning an event, or brainstorming about a new product.

Click and add a name for your project, then click **Save**. That's it — you've created a project!

Click the project to see **workspaces**, which are places where you can store and visually organize your content. When you made your project, Prysm also made a workspace named Default.

Click the **Default** workspace to open it and start adding content.
